# CPP_github_workflow

## Introduction

This repository contains a workflow for any C++ project with examples inside and the tools necessary for
* Building the executables
* Testing
* Automating documentation generation
* Ensuring code consistency among the repository


This README will not contain the entire documentation. For that, a dedicated gihub pages will be setup at this repository.

The pages are built using the documentation of the repository itself using Sphinx.
