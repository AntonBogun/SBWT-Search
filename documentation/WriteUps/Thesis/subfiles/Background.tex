\chapter{Background}\label{ch:Background}

This chapter will go through the necessary and interesting genomic biology aspects of the algorithm, for the reader to better understand the implications of the research.
It is meant for readers with little or no biological background, and as such it will start from the basics.
Then, a discussion of algorithms that have come before this thesis is made such that the algorithm introduced and its improvements are put into perspective.
