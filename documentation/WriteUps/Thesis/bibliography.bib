  abstract = {Motivation Huge data sets containing whole-genome sequences of bacterial strains are now commonplace and represent a rich and important resource for modern genomic epidemiology and metagenomics. In order to efficiently make use of these data sets, efficient indexing data structures {\textemdash} that are both scalable and provide rapid query throughput {\textemdash} are paramount.Results Here, we present Themisto, a scalable colored k-mer index designed for large collections of microbial reference genomes, that works for both short and long read data. Themisto indexes 179 thousand Salmonella enterica genomes in 9 hours. The resulting index takes 142 gigabytes, and Themisto pseudoaligns reads from a Salmonella enterica isolate sample against the index at a rate of 2 million base pairs per second on 48 threads. In comparison, the best competing tools Metagraph and Bifrost were only able to index 11 thousand genomes in the same time. In pseudoalignment, these other tools were either an order of magnitude slower than Themisto, or used an order of magnitude more memory. Themisto also offers superior pseudoalignment quality, achieving a higher recall than previous methods on Nanopore read sets.Availability and implementation Themisto is available and documented as a C++ package at https://github.com/algbio/themisto available under the GPLv2 license.Contact jarno.alanko{at}helsinki.fiSupplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = " Escherichia coli is a highly diverse organism that includes a range of commensal and pathogenic variants found across a range of niches and worldwide. In addition to causing severe intestinal and extraintestinal disease, E. coli is considered a priority pathogen due to high levels of observed drug resistance. The diversity in the E. coli population is driven by high genome plasticity and a very large gene pool. All these have made E. coli one of the most well-studied organisms, as well as a commonly used laboratory strain. Today, there are thousands of sequenced E. coli genomes stored in public databases. While data is widely available, accessing the information in order to perform analyses can still be a challenge. Collecting relevant available data requires accessing different sources, where data may be stored in a range of formats, and often requires further manipulation and processing to apply various analyses and extract useful information. In this study, we collated and intensely curated a collection of over 10 000 E. coli and Shigella genomes to provide a single, uniform, high-quality dataset. Shigella were included as they are considered specialized pathovars of E. coli . We provide these data in a number of easily accessible formats that can be used as the foundation for future studies addressing the biological differences between E. coli lineages and the distribution and flow of genes in the E. coli population at a high resolution. The analysis we present emphasizes our lack of understanding of the true diversity of the E. coli species, and the biased nature of our current understanding of the genetic diversity of such a key pathogen.",

  abstract={Immediately after birth, newborn babies experience rapid colonization by microorganisms from their mothers and the surrounding environment1. Diseases in childhood and later in life are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the colonization of the infant gut microbiota2. However, the effects of delivery via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period (≤1 month), remain controversial3,4. Here we report the disrupted transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section. These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period. We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic analysis to 1,679 gut microbiota samples (taken at several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy) from 596 full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of these babies, we collected additional matched samples from mothers (175 mothers paired with 178 babies). This analysis demonstrates that the mode of delivery is a significant factor that affects the composition of the gut microbiota throughout the neonatal period, and into infancy. Matched large-scale culturing and whole-genome sequencing of over 800 bacterial strains from these babies identified virulence factors and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance in opportunistic pathogens that may predispose individuals to opportunistic infections. Our findings highlight the critical role of the local environment in establishing the gut microbiota in very early life, and identify colonization with antimicrobial-resistance-containing opportunistic pathogens as a previously underappreciated risk factor in hospital births.},

  abstract={Opportunistic bacterial pathogen species and their strains that colonise the human gut are generally understood to compete against both each other and the commensal species colonising this ecosystem. Currently we are lacking a population-wide quantification of strain-level colonisation dynamics and the relationship of colonisation potential to prevalence in disease, and how ecological factors might be modulating these. Here, using a combination of latest high-resolution metagenomics and strain-level genomic epidemiology methods we performed a characterisation of the competition and colonisation dynamics for a longitudinal cohort of neonatal gut microbiomes. We found strong inter- and intra-species competition dynamics in the gut colonisation process, but also a number of synergistic relationships among several species belonging to genus Klebsiella, which includes the prominent human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. No evidence of preferential colonisation by hospital-adapted pathogen lineages in either vaginal or caesarean section birth groups was detected. Our analysis further enabled unbiased assessment of strain-level colonisation potential of extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) in comparison with their propensity to cause bloodstream infections. Our study highlights the importance of systematic surveillance of bacterial gut pathogens, not only from disease but also from carriage state, to better inform therapies and preventive medicine in the future.},

  abstract = "A method for DNA sequencing has been developed that utilises
              libraries of cloned randomly-fragmented DNA. The DNA to be
              sequenced is first subjected to limit attach by a non-specific
              endonuclease (DNase I in the presence of Mn++), fractionated by
              size and cloned in a single-stranded phage vector. Clones are
              then picked at random and used to provide a template for
              sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method.
              This technique was used to sequence completely a 4257 bp EcoRI
              fragment of bovine mitochondrial DNA. The cloned fragments were
              evenly distributed with respect to the EcoRI fragment, and
              completion of the entire sequence required the construction of
              only a single library. In general, once a clone library has been
              prepared, the speed of this approach (greater than 1000
              nucleotides of randomly selected sequence per day) is limited
              mainly by the rate at which the data can be processed. Because
              the clones are selected randomly, however, the average amount of
              new sequence information per clone is substantially diminished as
              the sequence near completion.",

              sequencing suggested a variant in the sodium channel Na(V)1.5

              sequencing of the trio confirmed read ratios inconsistent with
              Mendelian inheritance only in the proband. Genotyping of single
              circulating leukocytes demonstrated the mutation in the genomes
              of 8\% of patient cells, and RNA sequencing of cardiac tissue
              from the infant confirmed the expression of the mutant allele at
              mosaic ratios. Heterologous expression of the mutant channel
              revealed significantly delayed sodium current with a dominant
              negative effect. To investigate the mechanism by which mosaicism

It is also a crucial task as it guides many other tasks like phylogenetic analysis, function, and/or structure prediction of biological macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and Protein. Proteins are the building blocks of every living organism. Although protein alignment problem has been studied for several decades, unfortunately, every available method produces alignment results differently for a single alignment problem. Multiple sequence alignment is characterized as a very high computational complex problem. Many stochastic methods, therefore, are considered for improving the accuracy of alignment. Among them, many researchers frequently use Genetic Algorithm. In this study, we have shown different types of the method applied in alignment and the recent trends in the multiobjective genetic algorithm for solving multiple sequence alignment. Many recent studies have demonstrated considerable progress in finding the alignment accuracy.}

Current protocols for preparing DNA for next-generation targeted sequencing are labor-intensive, require large amounts of starting material, and are prone to artifacts that result from necessary PCR amplification of sequencing libraries. Typically, sample preparation for targeted NGS is a two-step process where (1) the desired regions are selectively captured and (2) the ends of the DNA molecules are modified to render them compatible with any given NGS sequencing platform.},

abstract={The trend toward very large DNA sequencing projects, such as those being undertaken as part of the Human Genome Program, necessitates the development of efficient and precise algorithms for assembling a long DNA sequence from the fragments obtained by shotgun sequencing or other methods. The sequence reconstruction problem that we take as our formulation of DNA sequence assembly is a variation of the shortest common superstring problem, complicated by the presence of sequencing errors and reverse complements of fragments. Since the simpler superstring problem is NP-hard, any efficient reconstruction procedure must resort to heuristics. In this paper, however, a four-phase approach based on rigorous design criteria is presented, and has been found to be very accurate in practice. Our method is robust in the sense that it can accommodate high sequencing error rates, and list a series of alternate solutions in the event that several appear equally good. Moreover, it uses a limited form of multiple sequence alignment to detect, and often correct, errors in the data. Our combined algorithm has successfully reconstructed nonrepetitive sequences of length 50,000 sampled at error rates of as high as 10{\%}.},

abstract={Liquid biopsy has proven valuable in identifying individual genetic alterations; however, the ability of plasma ctDNA to capture complex tumor phenotypes with clinical value is unknown. To address this question, we have performed 0.5X shallow whole-genome sequencing in plasma from 459 patients with metastatic breast cancer, including 245 patients treated with endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ET{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}CDK4/6i) from 2 independent cohorts. We demonstrate that machine learning multi-gene signatures, obtained from ctDNA, identify complex biological features, including measures of tumor proliferation and estrogen receptor signaling, similar to what is accomplished using direct tumor tissue DNA or RNA profiling. More importantly, 4 DNA-based subtypes, and a ctDNA-based genomic signature tracking retinoblastoma loss-of-heterozygosity, are significantly associated with poor response and survival outcome following ET{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}CDK4/6i, independently of plasma tumor fraction. Our approach opens opportunities for the discovery of additional multi-feature genomic predictors coming from ctDNA in breast cancer and other cancer-types.},

Yet, making all this sequencing data searchable and easily accessible to life science and data science researchers is an unsolved problem. We present MetaGraph, a versatile framework for the scalable analysis of extensive sequence repositories. MetaGraph efficiently indexes vast collections of sequences to enable fast search and comprehensive analysis. A wide range of underlying data structures offer different practically relevant trade-offs between the space taken by the index and its query performance. MetaGraph provides a flexible methodological framework allowing for index construction to be scaled from consumer laptops to distribution onto a cloud compute cluster for processing terabases to petabases of input data. Achieving compression ratios of up to 1,000-fold over the already compressed raw input data, MetaGraph can represent the content of large sequencing archives in the working memory of a single compute server. We demonstrate our framework{\textquoteright}s scalability by indexing over 1.4 million whole genome sequencing (WGS) records from NCBI{\textquoteright}s Sequence Read Archive, representing a total input of more than three petabases.Besides demonstrating the utility of MetaGraph indexes on key applications, such as experiment discovery, sequence alignment, error correction, and differential assembly, we make a wide range of indexes available as a community resource, including those over 450,000 microbial WGS records, more than 110,000 fungi WGS records, and more than 20,000 whole metagenome sequencing records. A subset of these indexes is made available online for interactive queries. All indexes created from public data comprising in total more than 1 million records are available for download or usage in the cloud.As an example of our indexes{\textquoteright} integrative analysis capabilities, we introduce the concept of differential assembly, which allows for the extraction of sequences present in a foreground set of samples but absent in a given background set. We apply this technique to differentially assemble contigs to identify pathogenic agents transfected via human kidney transplants. In a second example, we indexed more than 20,000 human RNA-Seq records from the TCGA and GTEx cohorts and use them to extract transcriptome features that are hard to characterize using a classical linear reference. We discovered over 200 trans-splicing events in GTEx and found broad evidence for tissue-specific non-A-to-I RNA-editing in GTEx and TCGA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, maximizing the quality of assemblies based on long reads is a challenging task that requires the development of specialized data analysis techniques. We present new algorithms for assembling long DNA sequencing reads from haploid and diploid organisms. The assembly algorithm builds an undirected graph with two vertices for each read based on minimizers selected by a hash function derived from the k-mer distribution. Statistics collected during the graph construction are used as features to build layout paths by selecting edges, ranked by a likelihood function. For diploid samples, we integrated a reimplementation of the ReFHap algorithm to perform molecular phasing. We ran the implemented algorithms on PacBio HiFi and Nanopore sequencing data taken from haploid and diploid samples of different species. Our algorithms showed competitive accuracy and computational efficiency, compared with other currently used software. We expect that this new development will be useful for researchers building genome assemblies for different species.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {Data compression is when you take a big chunk of data and crunch it down to fit into a smaller space. That data is put on ice; you have to un-crunch the compressed data to get at it. Data optimization, on the other hand, is when you take a chunk of data plus a collection of operations you can perform on that data, and crunch it into a smaller space while retaining the ability to perform the operations efficiently. This thesis investigates the problem of data optimization for some fundamental static data types, concentrating on linked data structures such as trees. I chose to restrict my attention to static data structures because they are easier to optimize since the optimization can be performed off-line.Data optimization comes in two different flavors: concrete and abstract. Concrete optimization finds minimal representations within a given implementation of a data structure; abstract optimization seeks implementations with guaranteed economy of space and time.I consider the problem of concrete optimization of various pointer-based implementations of trees and graphs. The only legitimate use of a pointer is as a reference, so we are free to map the pieces of a linked structure into memory as we choose. The problem is to find a mapping that maximizes overlap of the pieces, and hence minimizes the space they occupy.I solve the problem of finding a minimal representation for general unordered trees where pointers to children are stored in a block of consecutive locations. The algorithm presented is based on weighted matching. I also present an analysis showing that the average number of cons-cells required to store a binary tree of n nodes as a minimal binary DAG is asymptotic to $n/({piover 8}$ lg $n)sp{1/2}$.Methods for representing trees of n nodes in $O$($n$) bits that allow efficient tree-traversal are presented. I develop tools for abstract optimization based on a succinct representation for ordered sets that supports ranking and selection. These tools are put to use in a building an $O$($n$)-bit data structure that represents n-node planar graphs, allowing efficient traversal and adjacency-testing.},

	abstract = {The problem of sequence identification or matching {\textemdash} determining the subset of references from a given collection that are likely to contain a query nucleotide sequence {\textemdash} is relevant for many important tasks in Computational Biology, such as metagenomics and pan-genome analysis. Due to the complex nature of such analyses and the large scale of the reference collections a resource-efficient solution to this problem is of utmost importance. The reference collection should therefore be pre-processed into an index for fast queries. This poses the threefold challenge of designing an index that is efficient to query, has light memory usage, and scales well to large collections.To solve this problem, we describe how recent advancements in associative, order-preserving, k-mer dictionaries can be combined with a compressed inverted index to implement a fast and compact colored de Bruijn graph data structure. This index takes full advantage of the fact that unitigs in the colored de Bruijn graph are monochromatic (all k-mers in a unitig have the same set of references of origin, or {\textquotedblleft}color{\textquotedblright}), leveraging the order-preserving property of its dictionary. In fact, k-mers are kept in unitig order by the dictionary, thereby allowing for the encoding of the map from k-mers to their inverted lists in as little as 1 + o(1) bits per unitig. Hence, one inverted list per unitig is stored in the index with almost no space/time overhead. By combining this property with simple but effective compression methods for inverted lists, the index achieves very small space.We implement these methods in a tool called Fulgor. Compared to Themisto, the prior state of the art, Fulgor indexes a heterogeneous collection of 30,691 bacterial genomes in 3.8{\texttimes} less space, a collection of 150,000 Salmonella enterica genomes in approximately 2 {\texttimes} less space, and is at least twice as fast for color queries.2012 ACM Subject Classification Applied computing {\textrightarrow} BioinformaticsCompeting Interest StatementR.P. is a co-founder of Ocean Genomics Inc.},
