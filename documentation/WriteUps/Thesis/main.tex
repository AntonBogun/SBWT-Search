\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Credit where credit is due, I want to thank those people who shared their time with me, those who gave me a chance, and those who offered their services to me in some way or another during the past two years that I have spent pursuing this Master's Programme in Data Science. I will not mention any specific names, not only because they would most likely not fit into a single page, but because I am afraid I would forget someone. Those of you who fulfil the above criteria, you know who you are, and I am eternally grateful to you for cultivating my development and now I hope that I can make you proud with my future achievements.

The research work disclosed in this publication is partially funded by the Endeavour Scholarship Scheme (Malta). Project part-financed by the European Social Fund - Operational Programme II - European Structural and Investment Funds 2014-2020 "Investing in human capital to create more opportunities and promote the well-being of society".

% STEP 3:
% Write your abstract (of course you really do this last).
% You can make several abstract pages (if you want it in different languages),
% but you should also then redefine some of the above parameters in the proper
% language as well, in between the abstract definitions.

\begin{abstract}

Alignment in genomics is the process of finding the positions where DNA strings fit best with one another, that is, where there are the least differences if they were placed side by side.
This process, however, remains very computationally intensive, even with more recent algorithmic advancements in the field.
Pseudoalignment is emerging as a new method over full alignment as an inexpensive alternative, both in terms of memory needed as well as in terms of power consumption.
The process is to instead check for the existence of substrings within the target DNA, and this has been shown to produce good results for a lot of use cases.
New methods for pseudoalignment are still evolving, and the goal of this thesis is to provide an implementation that massively parallelises the current state of the art, Themisto, by using all resources available.
The most intensive parts of the pipeline are put on the GPU.
Meanwhile, the components which run on the CPU are heavily parallelised.
Reading and writing of the files is also done in parallel, so that parallel I/O can also be taken advantage of.
Results on the Mahti supercomputer, using an NVIDIA A100, shows a 10 times end-to-end querying speedup over the best run of Themisto, using half the CPU cores as Themisto, on the dataset used in this thesis.
